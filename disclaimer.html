                    <h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect is provided as a free online tool for optimizing and adjusting images for printing purposes. While we strive to provide accurate, reliable, and high-quality functionality, this tool is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We make no guarantees about the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of the tool for any particular purpose. Users acknowledge that they use PrintPerfect at their own risk and discretion. This disclaimer should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>2. Service Limitations</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect is designed to assist with print preparation but has inherent limitations. The tool's effectiveness depends on factors beyond our control, including the quality of source images, user settings and choices, browser capabilities and compatibility, device processing power, printer quality and calibration, paper type and quality, and environmental printing conditions. We cannot guarantee that images optimized through our tool will produce perfect prints in all circumstances. Results may vary based on these and other factors. Users should always test print small samples before committing to large or expensive print runs.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>3. Accuracy and Reliability</h2>
                    <p>While we implement industry-standard algorithms and best practices in our image processing functionality, we cannot guarantee absolute accuracy or freedom from errors. DPI calculations, color conversions, resolution adjustments, and dimension calculations are approximations based on standard formulas and may not perfectly reflect all printing scenarios. Preview renderings may not exactly match final printed output due to differences between screen display and physical printing. Quality indicators and recommendations are general guidelines and may not apply to all situations. We recommend users verify all settings and conduct test prints before finalizing important projects.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, PrintPerfect and its operators, developers, and affiliates shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from your use or inability to use the tool. This includes but is not limited to: loss of data or image files, print failures or unsatisfactory print quality, wasted materials (paper, ink, toner), financial losses from failed printing projects, time spent troubleshooting or reprinting, damage to printers or equipment, loss of business opportunities, or any other commercial damages or losses. This limitation applies even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability for consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
                    <p>Users of PrintPerfect bear full responsibility for: verifying the accuracy and suitability of tool outputs, maintaining backup copies of original images before processing, testing print settings on draft or sample prints before final production, ensuring compatibility with their specific printers and paper, verifying color accuracy for critical color-matching needs, assessing whether tool capabilities meet their specific requirements, and accepting all risks associated with print projects. We strongly recommend that users always keep original, unmodified versions of their images in a safe location separate from processed versions. Never rely solely on our tool for mission-critical or irreplaceable printing projects without extensive testing and verification.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>6. Printer Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect optimizes images for printing but does not control or interface with your actual printer hardware or software. Print results depend heavily on printer quality, capabilities, calibration, driver settings, ink or toner quality, and proper maintenance. What appears correct in our preview may print differently based on your printer's color management, DPI capabilities, and other technical specifications. Different printers interpret color, resolution, and sizing differently. We are not responsible for printer-specific issues, compatibility problems, or variations in output quality between different printer models or brands. Users should consult their printer documentation and conduct test prints to ensure desired results.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>7. Color Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
                    <p>Color representation is inherently complex and involves many variables. Colors displayed on your screen (RGB color space) will often differ from colors produced by printing (CMYK color space) due to fundamental differences in how screens emit light versus how printed materials reflect light. Monitor calibration, ambient lighting conditions, paper brightness and texture, ink formulations, and printer color profiles all affect color accuracy. Our color simulation and adjustment features provide approximations but cannot guarantee perfect color matching. For projects requiring precise color matching (such as branding materials), we recommend: using professionally calibrated monitors, conducting test prints, consulting with professional print services, and using Pantone or other standardized color systems. PrintPerfect is not responsible for color discrepancies between screen preview and printed output.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>8. Copyright and Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>Users must own the rights to all images they process through PrintPerfect or have obtained proper permissions for their intended use. We are not responsible for copyright infringement or intellectual property violations committed by users. By using our tool, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to process, modify, and print the images you upload. This includes images you created yourself, images you have licensed or purchased with appropriate rights, and images in the public domain. Do not use PrintPerfect to process copyrighted images without permission from the copyright holder. Unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material may violate copyright laws and could result in legal consequences for which PrintPerfect assumes no responsibility.</p>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>9. Professional Use Notice</h2>
                    <p>While PrintPerfect provides advanced features suitable for various printing needs, it is not a substitute for professional print preparation services in certain contexts. Commercial printing, high-stakes projects, legal documents, archival prints, medical imaging, and technical reproductions may require professional expertise, specialized equipment, and industry-specific standards that our tool cannot fully replicate. For mission-critical printing projects where accuracy and quality are paramount, we recommend consulting with professional print services. PrintPerfect is designed for general consumer and small business use and may not meet the rigorous standards required for certain professional or industrial applications.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>10. No Warranties</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to: implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, reliability, or quality of output. We do not warrant that the tool will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free. We do not warrant that results obtained from using the tool will be accurate or reliable.

                    <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect may contain links to third-party websites, services, or resources for your convenience and information. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for any third-party sites, products, or services. Links to external sites do not imply endorsement or recommendation. We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, terms of service, or functionality of linked sites. Accessing third-party websites is at your own risk.

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>12. Technical Requirements</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled and support for HTML5 Canvas API. Supported browsers include recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported.

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>13. Service Availability</h2>
                    <p>We strive to maintain consistent availability of PrintPerfect, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The tool may be unavailable due to: maintenance and updates, server issues or outages, technical difficulties, force majeure events, security concerns, or discontinuation of service. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of PrintPerfect at any time without prior notice or liability. We may impose limits on features, file sizes, or usage without notice. Users should not rely on PrintPerfect for time-critical projects without backup plans. We recommend processing important images well in advance of deadlines and maintaining offline copies of both original and processed files.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>14. Print Results Variation</h2>
                    <p>Actual print results will vary based on numerous factors outside our control. Paper type significantly affects appearance – glossy, matte, and textured papers render colors and details differently. Paper brightness, weight, and coating affect color vibrancy and saturation. Printer type (inkjet, laser, dye-sublimation, offset) produces different quality characteristics. Print resolution capabilities vary by printer model. Environmental conditions like humidity and temperature affect print quality. Ink or toner quality, age, and brand influence output. Printer maintenance and calibration status impacts consistency. Previous usage and print head condition matter for inkjet printers. We provide tools to optimize images, but cannot control these variables. Always conduct test prints and allow for iteration when quality is critical.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>15. Commercial Printing Advice</h2>
                    <p>For commercial printing projects where quality, color accuracy, and consistency are critical, we recommend working with professional print services that offer: color-managed workflows, proof prints for approval, specialized equipment and expertise, knowledge of paper stocks and finishes, understanding of binding and finishing options, and industry-standard quality control. While PrintPerfect can prepare images for professional printing, commercial printers often have specific requirements for file formats, color spaces, resolution, and bleed areas that may require additional preparation. Consult with your chosen print service about their requirements and provide them with both original and processed files when possible. For large print runs or expensive projects, always request physical proofs before approving final production.</p>
