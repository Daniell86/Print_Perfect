## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Best Print Quality

1. **Use high-resolution source images**
   - Minimum 300 DPI for print quality
   - Avoid web-sized low-res images

2. **Don't make images too large**
   - Pixelation occurs when scaling up too much
   - Keep within reasonable sizes

3. **Leave cutting margins**
   - Don't place images at exact edges
   - Leave 5-10mm margin for cutting

4. **Test print first**
   - Print on regular paper first
   - Check alignment and sizes
   - Adjust if needed, then print on good paper

5. **Use quality paper**
   - Photo paper for photos
   - Card stock for ID cards
   - Good quality A4 for documents

### For Aadhaar Cards Specifically

**Actual Aadhaar Size**: 8.5cm × 5.4cm (85mm × 54mm)

**Recommended Layout**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         A4 Page             │
│                             │

│  │ Front   │ │  Back   │  │
│  │         │ │         │  │
│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘  │
│                             │
│    (Add cutting guides)     │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Steps**:
1. Upload front and back images
