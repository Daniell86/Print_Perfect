                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to PrintPerfect. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any information you provide while using our online print adjustment tool. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices, what information we collect (or more importantly, don't collect), how we use it, and your rights regarding your personal information. By using PrintPerfect, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. We encourage you to read this policy carefully and contact us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>2. Information We Don't Collect</h2>
                    <p>Unlike many online services, PrintPerfect is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. <strong>We do not collect, store, or process your images</strong> on our servers. All image processing happens entirely within your web browser using client-side JavaScript technology. When you upload an image to our tool, it remains on your device and is processed locally. This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your images are never transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers</li>
                        <li>We never see, access, or store the content of your images</li>
                        <li>Your files remain completely private and under your control</li>
                        <li>Processing works even if you disconnect from the internet after the page loads</li>
                        <li>No one except you has access to your images during or after processing</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>3. No Server Uploads - Client-Side Processing</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect utilizes modern browser technologies (HTML5 Canvas API, FileReader API) to process images entirely within your browser. This architectural choice ensures maximum privacy and security. When you use our tool, the image data stays in your browser's memory and is never uploaded to external servers. Any adjustments, crops, filters, or optimizations you apply are computed locally on your device. This approach provides several key benefits: complete privacy for sensitive or personal images, faster processing without network latency, the ability to work offline once the page is loaded, and zero risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your files.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect uses minimal cookies and tracking technologies, and only for essential functionality. We use local storage to save your tool settings and preferences (such as your preferred DPI, paper size, and adjustment presets) so they persist between sessions. These settings are stored only on your device and are not transmitted to our servers. We may use anonymous analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to understand general usage patterns, page views, and feature popularity. These analytics are aggregated and anonymized – they do not identify individual users or track personal information. You can disable analytics tracking through browser settings or privacy extensions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect may integrate with minimal third-party services for specific functionality. Font Awesome is used for icons and is loaded from a CDN for performance. Google Fonts may be used for typography, also loaded from a CDN. These services may collect basic technical information such as IP addresses and browser types according to their own privacy policies. We do not share any personal information with these services, and they do not have access to your images or usage data beyond what is necessary for delivering their services (fonts and icons).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>6. Local Storage Usage</h2>
                    <p>We use browser local storage to enhance your experience by remembering your preferences. Information stored locally includes: your preferred print settings (paper size, DPI, orientation), custom adjustment presets you've created, UI preferences (which tabs you use most frequently), and recently used settings. This data is stored exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. You can clear this data at any time through your browser's settings or by using the reset options in our tool. Local storage does not contain any personally identifiable information or image data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>Because your images never leave your device, they are inherently secure from network-based threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks, server breaches, or unauthorized access to cloud storage. Our website is served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication between your browser and our servers for loading the application itself. We follow security best practices in our code to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and other client-side vulnerabilities. However, we recommend users take standard security precautions: keep their browsers updated, use reputable antivirus software, be cautious about browser extensions that might access page content, and avoid using public or shared computers for sensitive image processing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>8. User Data and Control</h2>
                    <p>You maintain complete control over your data when using PrintPerfect. You can view, modify, or delete any settings stored in local storage at any time. Your images remain on your device and are automatically cleared from browser memory when you close the tab or navigate away from the page. We provide clear controls for resetting all settings to defaults. You can use our tool without creating an account, providing personal information, or agreeing to data collection beyond what's stated in this policy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>9. International Users and GDPR Compliance</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect is accessible worldwide and complies with international privacy regulations including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Because we don't collect or store personal data or images, many provisions of these regulations don't apply to our core functionality. However, we respect the spirit of these laws and are committed to transparency and user control. For users in the European Economic Area: you have the right to access any information we have about you (which, for image data, is none), the right to rectification and erasure (easily accomplished by clearing local storage), the right to data portability (your settings can be exported if needed), and the right to object to processing (which doesn't apply since we don't process personal data on servers).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>PrintPerfect does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Our service is designed to be safe for users of all ages because we don't collect personal information or require account creation. Parents and guardians should supervise children's use of internet services. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 through our contact form or other means, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>11. Contact Form Data</h2>
                    <p>When you submit our contact form, we collect only the information you explicitly provide: your name, email address, subject selection, and message content. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and is not shared with third parties except as necessary to provide support (e.g., email service providers). We retain contact form submissions for a reasonable period to track support requests and improve our service, typically 1-2 years. You can request deletion of your contact form submissions at any time by emailing us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Significant changes will be announced on our website or through other communication channels. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of PrintPerfect after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

                <div class="fade-in">
                    <h2>13. Your Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information under applicable privacy laws. These rights may include: the right to access information we have about you, the right to correct inaccurate information, the right to delete your information (right to be forgotten), the right to restrict or object to processing, the right to data portability, and the right to withdraw consent. Given PrintPerfect's privacy-first architecture, most of these rights are automatically respected because we don't collect or store personal data on our servers.</p>
